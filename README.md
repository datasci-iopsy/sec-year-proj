# A Configurational Approach: Using Profiles to Investigate Organizational Justice Perceptions

## NC State I-O Psychology Program: Second Year Project (2017)

This repo comprises R code used to analyze data collected for my second year project. The manuscript is currently in progress, but I intend to further develop the code and thus augment the analyses as I gain more insight into additional techniques. Due to IRB regulations, the data is not openly provided (requests can be considered).

# Overview

The purpose of this study was to explore antecedents of organizational justice perceptions by utilizing a configurational approach. Self-report personality traits and dispositions were collected using a crowdsourced sample (*N* = 445). The latent profile analysis indicated three distinct profile patterns that were used to predict various levels of organizational justice perceptions; more specifically, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to measure the mean differences in justice perceptions between the profiles.
